# Introduction to Scala

## Comparing Java & Scala
* **Control and Type Constructs**
    * Compiling Java and Scala on the Command-Line
    * Scala as a Script!
    * Using REPL
    * Types and Type Inference in Java and Scala
    * ```var``` Vs ```val```
    * Optional semicolons
    * Statement Vs Expression (Mutation Vs Immutability)
        * ```if-else``` in Java and Scala
        * ```for```-loop in Java and ```for```-block, ```for-yield``` in Scala
    * Strings in Scala
        * Multi-line
        * Interpolation
    * Tuples and Multiple Assignments in Scala
    * Equality
        * `==` Vs `equals` in Java
            * `==` primitives: value-based comparison
            * `==` objects: identity-based comparison
            * `equals`: value-based comparison for objects
        * `==` Vs `eq` in Scala
            * `==` for value-based comparison across all types (primitives/objects)
            * `eq` for identity-based comparison

* **Object-Oriented Constructs**
    * class, method, object and function
        * class, method (Name Example)
            * Subsumed getters and setters
            * optional .
            * Classes and methods are public by default

* Contrasting Programming Paradigms
* Functions, Functions and Functions....
* Higher-Order Functions
